        <h1 id="topic">Is PCOS and PCOD are same? What is the difference between the two?</h1>
        <p id="the_art">PCOS is Polycystic Ovary Syndrome and PCOD means Polycystic Ovary Disease.
            So difference of S and D.<b> S stands for syndrome and D stands for disease.</b> Both these
            terms are often used interchangeably, but they are almost same with little difference
            between the two:</p><br><br>

            <p id="the_art"> <b class="br">Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS):</b> PCOS is a hormonal disorder affecting multiple systems of the body along with reproductive
                system involving ovaries. It affects women of reproductive age and presents as irregular
                menstrual periods, acne, weight gain, excess levels of androgens (male hormones) in the
                body, and multiple cysts on the ovaries shown on ultrasound. Women with PCOS may
                experience difficulty in conception. <br><br>
                <b class="br">PCOS is associated with insulin resistance, which can lead to an increased risk of type 2
                    diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and other health complications.</b>
            </p><br><br>

           <p id="the_art"> <b class="br" >Polycystic Ovary Disease (PCOD):</b>PCOD is a term which was used earlier as it was thought that it affects only ovaries and
            cause menstrual irregularities but this is not the case as it progresses well .PCOD may or
            may not involve elevated levels of androgens or insulin resistance, which are key features of
            PCOS. <br>PCOD is considered a milder form of PCOS, and some doctors use these two terms
            interchangeably, while others define both based on specific diagnostic criteria. <br><br>In conclusion PCOS and PCOD are same and it’s a matter of presentation and progression.
            PCOD not treated, not managed, not taken seriously progresses to PCOS which affects
            multiple systems of women body and creates detrimental effect on overall quality of
            women health. <br><br>So take your health and menstrual cycle seriously and adopt healthy life style in this modern
            era of extreme professional stress as well as adverse environmental state. If you have any
            further doubts, don’t hesitate to consult expert <a href="https://g.co/kgs/iy6rzDe">Dr.Kusum Lata</p><br><br>
